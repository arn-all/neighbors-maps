The interactive version of the tutorial is available here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pgrigorev/neighbors-maps.git/HEAD?labpath=tutorials%2Fdefect_detection.ipynb). Simply click on this button and it should start an interactive session for you. It is hosted on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which is free and community supported, however the servers can be overloaded quite frequently. Try to start it few times. If it does not work we have prepared a [Google Colaboratory version of the notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lxYW66vzPfTha10RF6YeXekU0I8DKRb9?usp=sharing). 

Finally, the best way to play with this tutorial is to run it locally on your own computer. You will need to have a python3 installation which can be esily obtained with [Conda installation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation). After that you can simply clone this repository and install the required dependencies by running the following script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pgrigorev/neighbors-maps.git
cd neighbor-maps
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

It might take a moment to install everything and after that you can simply launch JupyterLab by typing in `jupyter-lab` in your terminal. This will open an interface in your browser where you can open the notebook and start exploring.
